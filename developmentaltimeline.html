        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>Infancy (Trust vs. Mistrust)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: As a baby, my parents took care of my every need. Fed me when I was hungry, comforted me when I cried which helped me develop a sense of trust in them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>Early Childhood (Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: When I was two years old, I didn't like my parents tying my shoes for me so they bought velcro shoes that I could put on myself making me feel independent and capable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>Preschool (Initiative vs. Guilt)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: In preschool I had a large toy kitchen and I would pretend that I was running a restaurant and I had to take initiative to make sure the "customers" were happy and got their food as fast as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>School Age (Industry vs. Inferiority)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: In 4th or 5th grade when we were learning our multiplication tables we would get to go to an ice cream party if we did good enough and so everyone worked to master multiplication and we would challenge each other to see who got the most correct answers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>Adolescence (Identity vs. Role Confusion)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: My family used to be very religious and we would always go to church on Sundays, but around the age of 13-14 I started to develop my own ideas about the universe and decided that I didn't believe in a "god" that created everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>Young Adulthood (Intimacy vs. Isolation)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: As I have matured I have been able to form closer relationships to my family and my siblings, overcoming silly childish arguments and disputes that siblings are known for having when they are younger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>Middle Adulthood (Generativity vs. Stagnation)</h3>
            <p>Plan: I don't plan on having children but I want to be able to live stress free and have a stable job to provide for myself. I will have many nephews and nieces most likely that I can help take care of and watch grow up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Erikson's Stages</div>
            <h3>Maturity (Integrity vs. Despair)</h3>
            <p>Plan: At this stage I hope to be able to look back at my life and feel satisfied that I made the most of every moment and I lived as happily as I could. I expect not to have any regrets at this point or problems looking back at my life and the choices I made.</p>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Piaget's Stages</div>
            <h3>Sensorimotor Stage (Birth to 2 years)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: My parents shared a story where my older siblings liked to tease me with peekaboo because I would get upset every time they hid but I would get excited when they revealed themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Piaget's Stages</div>
            <h3>Preoperational Stage (2 to 7 years)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: When I was around age 4 or 5 I remember that I believed the moon would follow me a night and no one else. I didn't think about how other people see it differently from me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Piaget's Stages</div>
            <h3>Concrete Operational Stage (7 to 11 years)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: I think I was around 8 or 9 and in third grade and I remember my teacher explaining to me the concept of conservation, though she didn't call it that at the time, by pouring water back and forth between two different sized cups showing me that it didn't change the amount of water that was in each cup, I also remember it blowing my mind at the time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Piaget's Stages</div>
            <h3>Formal Operational Stage (12 years and up)</h3>
            <p>Personal example: Around 12-14 I started being able to think about situations differently, and think about hypothetical situations and the possible outcomes. Creating plans for my future and where I want to end up.</p>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Kohlberg's Levels</div>
            <h3>Pre-conventional Level</h3>
            <p>Personal example: As a young child I remember when my mom would buy us treats like brownies or cookies and I would look at them before dinner and get scared of taking one because I was scared of being punished.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Kohlberg's Levels</div>
            <h3>Conventional Level</h3>
            <p>Personal example: In late elementary school and early middle school, I dedicated myself a lot more to group projects because I wanted my friends and teachers to see me as reliable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
            <div class="timeline-label">Kohlberg's Levels</div>
            <h3>Post-conventional Level</h3>
            <p>From around the age of 16 to present, I have developed my own ideas and moral guidelines that I view society through. What I view as moral doesn't always match what other people see as moral but I stick by my principles even if they are unpopular and others might disagree with me.
