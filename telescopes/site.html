            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Telescopes are powerful instruments that have transformed our ability to see distant objects especially when it comes to astronomy and celestial bodies. Since their invention in the 17th century, telescopes have evolved from simple lenses that could barely magnify to large sophisticated devices that can see distabnt galaxies, detect invisible wavelengths, and even work while out in space. </p>

    <div id="origins" class="content-section">
        <div class="text-box">
            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>The invention of the telescope was a pivotal moment in human history, forever changing the human understanding of space and the cosmos. Knowledge of optics, the behavior and properties of light, can be traced back to medieval scholars, it wasn't until1608 in the Netherlands that eyeglass makers Hans Lippershey, Zachairas Janssen, and Jacob Metius developed the first practical telescopes. This tool was the result of innovation and craftmanship in optics developing over centuries.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Initially, telescopes were only used for Earth-bound purposes such as surveying and certain military applications. In 1609 this changed, Galileo Galilei turned a telescope to the sky, making observations that would revolutionize astronomy. He made improvements to the telescope like increasing its magnification from only three times to thirty times allowing him to make celestial observations in never before seen ways. Galileo was able to highlight the potential of the telescope and its ability to change science.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Early telescopes were rudimentary compared to those of today, but they were a clear division in the history of astronomy. Before telescopes, we were limited to only what we could see with the naked eye, and with the invention of telescopes we could see into unseen worlds and countless discoveries.</p>

    <div id="modern" class="content-section">
        <div class="text-box">
            <h2>Modern Advances</h2>
            <p>Today's most powerful telescopes use many forms of advanced technology, from giant mirrors that focus light onto high tech detectors to large complex arrays of telescopes that all work together as one. Replacing the human eye with detectors allows for telescopes to reveal more distant astronomical objects and phenomena than ever before. Many kinds of telescopes exist today for a variety of purposes like visible-light telescopes, gamma ray and x-ray telescopes, and radio and submilimeter telescopes. Thanks to these tools, astronomers can explore the entire of spectrum of light from visible light to invisible wavelengths of radio, X-ray, and gamma ray light that our eyes normally can't detect.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h3>Visible-Light Telescopes</h3>
            <p>The most well known form of astronomy is visible-light or optical astronomy has been used since the telescopes inverntion and has stayed relevant since. Stars emit most of their light in the visible spectrum so optical telescopes are vital for studying them, as well as galaxies and planets. Some of the largest visible-light telescopes include the twin Magellan Telescopes in Chile, and the MMT in Arizona, each with mirrors over 21 feet in diameter. The giant Magellan Telescope in Chile will feature seven massive mirros that all work together to create a primary mirro 72 feet across. This telescope will create detailed observations of exoplanets discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satelite which searches for planets across a large area of the sky using smaller telescopes.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h3>Gamma-Ray and X-Ray Telescopes</h3>
            <p>Visible light is able to pass through Earth's atmosphere while high energy radiation like gamma rays and X-rays cannot, making observations from Earth impossible. Specialized telescopes like VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope) are able to detect light that gamma rays product when they hit the atmosphere. Astronomers are now able to study extreme enviornments like supernovas and black hole surroundings. X-ray astronomy relies on tools like NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory that orbits in space to avoid interference created by the atmnosphere. Since normal mirrors can't reflect X-rays, Chandra uses special mirros that focus X-rays by letting them "skim" off of the surface of the mirror that allows it to observe phenomena from within our solar system and even distant galaxies.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h3>Radio and Submilimeter Telescopes</h3>
            <p>Radio waves and submilimeter light have longer wavelengths than visible light so it requires much larger telescopes to make detailed images. To reach the level of precision needed to create these images, astronomers will create large arrays of telescopes that work together as a single virtual telescope. One example is the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii that consists of eight 6 meter dishes capable of seeing through clouds of gas and dust that block visible light. The even larger Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile makes observations of star formations in distant galaxies. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is one of the most ambitious astronomical projects and combines observatories across the globe (including SMA) to form a planet sized virtual telescope that is the first to capture an image of a black hole in the galaxy M87.</p>

            <h2>Impact on Society</h2>
            <p>Telescopes have had a deep impact on society by transforming our understanding of the universe and out place in it. Early telescopic discoveries from Galileo challenged existing beliefs and helped drive the scientific revolution. Modern telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope, continue to capture breathtaking images of space, providing opportunities for people to learn and be inspired by the cosmos.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Telescopes have also contributed a great deal to technological advances. Innovations in optics that were initially developed for astronomy, not benefits other career fields like medical imaging. Large scale telescope projects create international collaboration, advancing not just one country's scientifics efforts but the entire worlds. Telescopes continue to be one of the most influential scientific tools ever created.</p>
